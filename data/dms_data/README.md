# Experimental data

Each dataset has its own directory containing the following:
- The dataset .tsv file, a tab-separated dataframe with columns for the variant, number of mutations, and functional score. 
- A splits directory containing train, validation, and test splits that have been saved as files for reuse and reproducibility.

Additionally, there is a dataset index file, [datasets.yml](datasets.yml), with additional information about each dataset, such as the name, directory, and wild-type sequence.
